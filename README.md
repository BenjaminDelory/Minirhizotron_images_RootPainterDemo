# Minirhizotron_images_RootPainterDemo
This dataset consists of 100 minirhizotron images (2340 x 2400 pixels; resolution: 148 px/mm) taken with the manual UHD minirhizotron camera (VSI-BARTZ MS-190) from Vienna Scientific Instruments.  The images were acquired in a grassland field experiment (POEM experiment) in which the order of arrival of three plant functional groups (forbs, grasses and legumes) was manipulated. In each plot, two root observation tubes were installed at a 45Â° angle six months before the start of the experiment (i.e. the first sowing event on April 13, 2021). Along each tube, images are taken at 18 different depths (from 1.4 to 49.5 cm) twice a month from April to September and once a month from October to March.  The POEM experiment is funded by the German Research Foundation.
